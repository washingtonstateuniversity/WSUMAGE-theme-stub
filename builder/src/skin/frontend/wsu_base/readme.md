#NOTE
The folder `your-theme-folder` should be named as the theme name.  The standared pratice is that you use the url as the name.  For example, if your store name is `connections.store.wsu.edu` then that theme name is `connections.store.wsu.edu` to which this folder,  `your-theme-folder` would be named as such.

# WSUMAGE-theme-stub
a stub that has the builder in it for working with Magento themes

The standared pratice is that you use the url as the name.  For example, if your store name is `connections.store.wsu.edu` then that theme name is `connections.store.wsu.edu`.  The `builder` folder is not to be pushed to the server, it would be excluded in the cloning/coping.

###Sample `gitploy` commands to follow, and more information on how to use.
